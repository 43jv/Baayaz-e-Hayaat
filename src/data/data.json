  "About": {
    "paragraph": "“Bayaaz” in Urdu refers to a notebook or diary in which people write their favourite poetry or other memorable ideas and words. Owning and maintaining a bayaaz was once considered a mark of education and cultivation, for without a thorough knowledge of poetry, no person was deemed to be truly educated or cultured. Over time, as middle-class women acquired education, a bayaaz or notebook acquired new functionalities that represented the different roles women had to simultaneously juggle. Hyderabadi writer Zeenath Sajida (1924-2009) has eloquently described how a bayaaz is, in fact, a metaphor for the reality of women’s lives, for squeezed between lists of expenses and other domestic priorities – are their dreams and aspirations, writings and plans, hurriedly scribbled in the margins, recorded on the edges of time. Bayaaz-e-Hayaat, or the “Notebook of Life,” aims to collect, digitize, preserve, and exhibit in different media the private and literary papers of writers, scholars, and intellectuals working in different languages in Hyderabad."
