                  “Bayaaz” in Urdu refers to a notebook or diary in which people
                  write their favourite poetry or other memorable ideas and
                  words. Owning and maintaining a bayaaz was once considered a
                  mark of education and cultivation, for without a thorough
                  knowledge of poetry, no person was deemed to be truly educated
                  or cultured. Over time, as middle-class women acquired
                  education, a bayaaz or notebook acquired new functionalities
                  that represented the different roles women had to
                  simultaneously juggle. Hyderabadi writer Zeenath Sajida
                  (1924-2009) has eloquently described how a bayaaz is, in fact,
                  a metaphor for the reality of women’s lives, for squeezed
                  between lists of expenses and other domestic priorities – are
                  their dreams and aspirations, writings and plans, hurriedly
                  scribbled in the margins, recorded on the edges of time.
                  Bayaaz-e-Hayaat, or the “Notebook of Life,” aims to collect,
                  digitize, preserve, and exhibit in different media the private
                  and literary papers of writers, scholars, and intellectuals
                  working in different languages in Hyderabad.
